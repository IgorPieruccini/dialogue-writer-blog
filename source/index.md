## What's this blog about?

It's a documentation of the process, thoughts, experimentation and all sort of challenges I go thought while developing a project called **Dialogue Writer** which I've choose to work as a way of learn and put in practice few technologies that i would like to get a deeper understand of, such as:

- [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Mongdb](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/)
- [Graphql](https://graphql.org/)

Those are only the main ones, and I'm sure more frameworks and tools will come in handy while developing this project.

## What's the "Dialogue Writer" Project ?

It's a dashboard to enable writers to create "game scripts" in the most native way possible for them. Writers when creating a story, it's most important to focus on the story (scripts) itself than spend time dealing with the tool. Writers must be provided with a tool that they're already comfortable using such as World or Google Docs and at the same time flexible for the Developer to pool this data, structure in a simple and efficient way to be used inside their games.

## Why did I decide to blog/document?

I've started many projects in the course of my professional carrier, and mostly of them ended up on my backup driver or archived on my github after few months, The good think is that i always learned something new with those projects like a new framework, language, game engine, library and concepts, for many times those new things gave me a different technical perspective to see a problem, helped me to shape a new mind set. But all of this new things are abstracts and it's not something I can show and share. Unless I document the process, thoughts and challenges I've been thought along this experience.
