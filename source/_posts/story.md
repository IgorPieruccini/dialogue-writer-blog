After Prototyping the next step is to set goes and design for the project, for that i've create a list of User Story therefore plaining what are the features, tools, and the architecture of the product I'm building. This helps me visualize what the product needs and will look like.

To create the User Story, I've set down with my sketch book and wrote everything that the user should be able to do and already choose few names I will use for define the different areas of the project.

After I had a quite few User Story that i think should cover a good amount of work and a good start for the project, I've took each one of the user story and create tickets with a more detailed description in Trello, so I have a Project Plaining, which I found quite useful to help me keep tracking of what a have to do.

For organizing the tickets in different scope and areas of the product I've created labels and assigned to the tickets to help me identify which tickets belong together while developing.

Before jumping into code, I will create Mockups to help me visualize the architecture and functionality of the product.
