Before jumping into code I like to have **Mockups** that help me visualize what must be build, and think more precisely about the architecture the shape of my data and where each data will leave.

One advantage of creating mockups is that I can easily see how i will separate my components and what are the components responsible for, this way i can abstract and reuse components easily throughout the application.

[Here](http://localhost:4000/mockup.html) you can check the mockup I've created to begin the project, This mockup is far away from being the application, still missing a lot of things, but it has everything i need to start working on the first plaining tickets that i have on Trello.
